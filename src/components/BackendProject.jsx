            I have created a Full-Stack project using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js,
            React.js, Node.js). In this project, there are two roles: User and
            Admin. The User can upload an image of their laptop and raise a
            complaint about any issue they are facing. The Admin can review the
            raised issues and provide solutions accordingly.
